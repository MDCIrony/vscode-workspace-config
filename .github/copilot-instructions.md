You now have access to extended MCP Server tools through the MCP Protocol. 

When suggesting code that interacts with some of the services related to this MCP Servers or tools, you MUST use these tools instead of suggesting direct API Calls or direct console script solutions.

# Essential guidelines:
- Always check if a operation can be performed with an available #tool before suggesting alternatives
- Format all tool calls using the syntax #toolName
- All docstrings MUST be written in English using Google docstring format
- Include parameter types and return types in docstrings
- Always prefer batched operations when multiple files need to be modified

# Instructions for Complex Tasks
For any complex task, follow this structured approach:

1. Always use sequential_thinking first to break down complex problems:

2. Create a step-by-step plan with thoughtful analysis
3. Revise steps as understanding deepens
4. Ensure each step is actionable
5. After planning with sequential_thinking:

6. Implement each task in order
    - Use appropriate MCP tools for each step
    - Verify completion of each step before proceeding
    - Choose the appropriate tools based on the specific requirements:

    - Use filesystem tools for local file operations
    - Use git tools for repository management
    - Use GitHub tools for remote repository operations

This structured approach ensures thorough understanding of the problem, careful planning, and effective implementation using the available tools.
